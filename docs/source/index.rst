Welcome to rclUE's documentation!
===================================

**rclUE** is a `ROS2 <https://docs.ros.org/en/foxy/index.html#>`_
client library for Unreal Engine.
rclUE is a UE Plugin which bridges `Unreal Engine <https://www.unrealengine.com/en-US/?lang=en-US>`_
and ROS2, opening UE’s tools to ROS developers through a C++ interface.
Furthermore non-ROS engineers should be able to quickly set up robot simulations
through UE’s blueprint visual scripting language by using the instruments
that ROS developers and the plugin exposed.

This document includes not only rclUE but also an overview of its stakeholders from various repositories.
Please check the :doc:`overview`.

A demo of our tool can be found in our port of the `turtlebot examples to UE <https://github.com/rapyuta-robotics/turtlebot3-UE>`_.
