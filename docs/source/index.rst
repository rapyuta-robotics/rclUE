Welcome to rclUE's documentation!
===================================

**rclUE** is a ROS2 client library for Unreal Engine.
rclUE is a UE4 Plugin whih bridges UE4 and ROS2, 
opening UE4’s tools to ROS developers through a C++ interface. 
Furthermore non-ROS engineers should be able to quickly set up robot simulations 
through UE4’s blueprint visual scripting language by using the instruments 
that ROS developers and the plugin exposed. 

A demo of our tool can be found in our port of the `turtlebot examples to UE4 <https://github.com/rapyuta-robotics/turtlebot3-UE>`_.
The project relies on our rclUE plugin for ROS2 as well as the `RapyutaSimulationPlugins <https://github.com/rapyuta-robotics/RapyutaSimulationPlugins>`_ for additional support.
