# RclUE and ROS2

## Description
- We use ros2 'foxy' lightweighted (not all binaries are included). Source/ThirdParty/ros folder is fully autogenerated by Scripts/update_ros.py (check script to see what is actually includes).
- ros includes [UE_msgs](https://github.com/rapyuta-robotics/UE_msgs)
- Ros2 middleware, Product name: eProsima Fast DDS, License: Apache 2, RMW implementation: rmw_fastrtps_cpp
- to use this plugin change the world settings to use meters as units instead of the default centimeters
- within the Unreal Editor: Edit->Plugins, search and enable for `rclc`
- For messages not in std_msgs, the appropriate library path needs to be added to LD_LIBRARY_PATH

## Windows is currently unsupported

# Getting Started
The plugin folder contains a video "Example_BP_PubSub.mp4" demonstrating how to setup a PubSub example in Blueprint.

An example setup using this plugin can be found at [turtlebot3-UE](https://github.com/rapyuta-robotics/turtlebot3-UE)

# Notes on working with ROS2 and UE4
- rcl and void* types cannot be managed by UE4 (no UPROPERTY) and therefore can't be used directly in Blueprint. Whenever access to these variables is needed, the user should write a class to wrap it and all of their handling must be done in C++.
- some basic numerical types are not natively supported in Blueprint (e.g. double, unsigned int). In order to use these, a workaround is needed (a plugin implementing those types for BP, a modified UE4 or a custom implementation).
- In autogenerated messages, the method MsgToString() should be implemented by the user as its current purpose is to help debugging.
