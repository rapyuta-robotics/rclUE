# Installation

## How to install this plugin (Ubuntu 20):
1. clone this repository in your Unreal Engine 4 Plugin folder
2. create and use the following shell script to run the UE4 editor (substituting `PROJECT_PATH`, `PROJECT_NAME` and `UNREAL_ENGINE_REPO` for the appropriate strings):
```
#!/bin/sh

export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=\
"${PWD}/Plugins/rclUE/Source/ThirdParty/ros2lib":\
"${PWD}/Plugins/rclUE/Source/ThirdParty/ros2lib/std_msgs/lib":\
"${PWD}/Plugins/rclUE/Source/ThirdParty/ros2lib/geometry_msgs/lib":\
"${PWD}/Plugins/rclUE/Source/ThirdParty/ros2lib/sensor_msgs/lib":\
"${PWD}/Plugins/rclUE/Source/ThirdParty/ros2lib/rosgraph_msgs/lib":\
"${PWD}/Plugins/rclUE/Source/ThirdParty/ros2lib/nav_msgs/lib":\
"${PWD}/Plugins/rclUE/Source/ThirdParty/ros2lib/tf2_msgs/lib":\
"${PWD}/Plugins/rclUE/Source/ThirdParty/ros2lib/builtin_interfaces/lib":\
"${PWD}/Plugins/rclUE/Source/ThirdParty/ros2lib/ue4_interfaces/lib":\
"${PWD}/Plugins/rclUE/Source/ThirdParty/ros2lib/ue_msgs/lib"

EDITOR_COMMAND="UNREAL_ENGINE_REPO/Engine/Binaries/Linux/UE4Editor"

(exec "$EDITOR_COMMAND" "PROJECT_PATH/PROJECT_NAME.uproject")
```
3. For messages not in std_msgs, the appropriate library path needs to be added to LD_LIBRARY_PATH
4. within the Unreal Editor: Edit->Plugins, search and enable for `rclc`
5. add a PubSubExample actor to the scene and test
6. change the world settings to use meters as units instead of the default centimeters
