Please setup UE4 by following [Linux Quick Start](https://docs.unrealengine.com/4.27/en-US/SharingAndReleasing/Linux/BeginnerLinuxDeveloper/SettingUpAnUnrealWorkflow/)

## Branches

### master

This build of the plugin is based on ROS2 Foxy and has been tested on Ubuntu 20.

This branch currently represents the release branch.

### Other branches

Experimental and WIP

# RclUE and ROS2

## Description
- We use ros2 'foxy' lightweighted (not all binaries are included). Source/ThirdParty/ros folder is fully autogenerated by Scripts/update_ros.py (check script to see what is actually includes).
- ros includes [UE_msgs](https://github.com/rapyuta-robotics/UE_msgs)
- Ros2 middleware, Product name: eProsima Fast DDS, License: Apache 2, RMW implementation: rmw_fastrtps_cpp
- to use this plugin change the world settings to use meters as units instead of the default centimeters
- within the Unreal Editor: Edit->Plugins, search and enable for `rclc`

## Windows is currently unsupported

# Getting Started

The plugin folder contains a video "Example_BP_PubSub.mp4" demonstrating how to setup a PubSub example in Blueprint.

An example setup using this plugin can be found at [turtlebot3-UE](https://github.com/rapyuta-robotics/turtlebot3-UE)

# Notes on working with ROS2 and UE4

- rcl and void\* types cannot be managed by UE4 (no UPROPERTY) and therefore can't be used directly in Blueprint. Whenever access to these variables is needed, the user should write a class to wrap it and all of their handling must be done in C++.
- some basic numerical types are not natively supported in Blueprint (e.g. double, unsigned int). In order to use these, a workaround is needed (a plugin implementing those types for BP, a modified UE4 or a custom implementation).
- In autogenerated messages, the method MsgToString() should be implemented by the user as its current purpose is to help debugging.

# How to update ROS inside RclUE
Currently there is a scripts in [UE_tools](https://github.com/rapyuta-robotics/UE_tools) for automatic build and update ROS2 (foxy) libraries. Following steps 1) build and copy ros2 base library under rclUE, 2) generatee UE src codes to access msg from UE. Please check UE_tools README and `UE_tools/default_config.yaml`
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/rapyuta-robotics/UE_tools
   cd UE_tools
   
   # build and copy ros2 base libraries
   python3 build_install_codegen.py -b --remove --type base
   
   # Generate msg classes to access msg from UE
   python3 build_install_codegen.py -bc --type pkgs
   ```
