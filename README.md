# Basic information
## Supported versions
- Ubuntu 20.04
- Unreal Engine 4.27
- ROS2 Foxy

## Branches
### master
This build of the plugin is based on ROS2 Foxy and has been tested on Ubuntu 20. 

This branch currently represents the release branch.

### Other branches
Experimental and WIP

# Update ros2
To add or update part of ros2, for example 'rclc', branch 'foxy':
1. Build ros2 https://docs.ros.org/en/foxy/Installation/Ubuntu-Development-Setup.html
2. Clone part:
git clone -b foxy https://github.com/ros2/rclc.git
3. Make sure you installed colcon https://docs.ros.org/en/foxy/Tutorials/Colcon-Tutorial.html#create-a-workspace
4. Build .so lib:
. ~/ros2_foxy/install/local_setup.bash
colcon build --packages-up-to --allow-overriding rclc
(or without --allow-overriding, it's only in my case)
5. Copy-replace includes and lib to appropriate folders to rclUE/Source/ThirdParty/ros2lib

# Installation

## How to add this plugin to an Unreal Engine 4 project (Ubuntu 20):
1. clone this repository in your project Plugin folder
2. create and use the following shell script to run the UE4 editor (substituting `PROJECT_PATH`, `PROJECT_NAME` and `UNREAL_ENGINE_REPO` for the appropriate strings):
```
#!/bin/sh

export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=\
"${PWD}/Plugins/rclUE/Source/ThirdParty/ros2lib":\
"${PWD}/Plugins/rclUE/Source/ThirdParty/ros2lib/std_msgs/lib":\
"${PWD}/Plugins/rclUE/Source/ThirdParty/ros2lib/example_interfaces/lib":\
"${PWD}/Plugins/rclUE/Source/ThirdParty/ros2lib/geometry_msgs/lib":\
"${PWD}/Plugins/rclUE/Source/ThirdParty/ros2lib/sensor_msgs/lib":\
"${PWD}/Plugins/rclUE/Source/ThirdParty/ros2lib/rosgraph_msgs/lib":\
"${PWD}/Plugins/rclUE/Source/ThirdParty/ros2lib/builtin_interfaces/lib":\
"${PWD}/Plugins/rclUE/Source/ThirdParty/ros2lib/ue4_interfaces/lib"

EDITOR_COMMAND="UNREAL_ENGINE_REPO/Engine/Binaries/Linux/UE4Editor"

(exec "$EDITOR_COMMAND" "PROJECT_PATH/PROJECT_NAME.uproject")
```
3. For messages not in std_msgs, the appropriate library path needs to be added to LD_LIBRARY_PATH
4. within the Unreal Editor: Edit->Plugins, search and enable for `rclc`
5. change the world settings to use meters as units instead of the default centimeters
6. Example_BP_PubSub.mp4 shows how to build a PubSub example using Blueprint

## Windows is currently unsupported

- librmw_dds_common__rosidl_typesupport_cpp.so (Ubuntu 20/Foxy)
- librmw_dds_common__rosidl_typesupport_fastrtps_cpp.so (Ubuntu 20/Foxy)

# Getting Started
The plugin folder contains a video "Example_BP_PubSub.mp4" demonstrating how to setup a PubSub example in Blueprint.

An example setup for Turtlebot3 using this plugin can be found at https://github.com/rapyuta-robotics/turtlebot3-UE

# Notes on working with ROS2 and UE4
- rcl and void* types cannot be managed by UE4 (no UPROPERTY) and therefore can't be used directly in Blueprint. Whenever access to these variables is needed, the user should write a class to wrap it and all of their handling must be done in C++.
- some basic numerical types are not natively supported in Blueprint (e.g. double, unsigned int). In order to use these, a workaround is needed (a plugin implementing those types for BP, a modified UE4 or a custom implementation).
- In autogenerated messages, the method MsgToString() should be implemented by the user as its current purpose is to help debugging.
